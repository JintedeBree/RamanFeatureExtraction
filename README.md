# RamanFeatureExtraction
A MATLAB based Raman Feature extraction app which can extract morphological and chemical characteristics from microcalcifications present in a Raman microspectroscopic raster scan of 40x40 (56x56 um). This script is written by Jinte de Bree as part of a bachelor thesis 'Hyperspectral Raman imaging of breast tissue microcalcifications: differentiating benign and malignant pathologies', University of Twente, the Netherlands.

FeatureExtractionPipeline.mlapp is the main app, which calls the functions present in folder 'FunctionsRFE'. An explanation of how the app should be used to extract characteristics from the Raman microscopic raster scan:


The FunctionsRFe folder contains all the functions needed to run the app. A detailed description of each function is included in their script. The FunctionsRFE folder should be in the same folder as the FeatureExtractionPipeline.mlapp.

The TestFiles folder contains four example .asc files which can be used to test the app.

The Results_benignVdcisVidcVcombi.csv file contains the
